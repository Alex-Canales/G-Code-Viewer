###Functionalities
* Displaying arcs
* Interpreting relative position mode
* Add a "step-by-step" functionality
* Displaying 3D representation of the result
* Animation?
### UI
* Orthogonal view
* Different coloration for G0 vs G1/G2/G3 (maybe red for G0 and blue for G1)
* Resize base grid to match extents of cut in XY
* Auto zoom to extent of the part when loaded
* Ability to highlight based on line number to "step through" files
* Marker showing origin?
* Indicator of current tool location?
* Ability to set initial position of the tool?
